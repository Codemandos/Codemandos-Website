Welcome to the HHS Codemandos!
============================================================

Looking to learn how to program? Or maybe you're already an experienced developer, and you're just looking for a place to work with others and share your work? You've come to the right place. Welcome to the club! We're excited to have you.

If you're new to the club, take a look at our [RULES](Rules.md), and be sure to always respect them. We're pretty laid back, so as long as you're not being intentionally mean to someone, it should be fun for everyone.

We regularly meet on ...? in Mr. Wilkins's room (Room 234) from 3:00 until 4:30PM. Come hang out with us!

All the materials you should need should be available to you on the official Codemandos Website, www.codemandos.club or www.codemandos.tk

Have any questions? Start by texting @codemandos to 81010. Shortly you should get a confirmation message, from which you can reply with any question about the club or meetings. You will also get weekly reminders and important info.
